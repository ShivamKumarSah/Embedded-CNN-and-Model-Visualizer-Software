# Embedded-CNN-and-Model-Visualizer-Software
This project is a GUI-based application designed to work with various embedded system boards, allowing users to upload custom CNN models in `.h5` format, process images, and visualize the results. The application performs image recognition with bounding boxes and offers 3D visualization of the modelâ€™s output.

## Features
- **Embedded System Support**: Select different embedded system boards for processing.
- **Model Upload**: Upload CNN models in `.h5` format.
- **Image Processing**: Upload an image to be processed by the model.
- **Bounding Box**: Visualize image recognition results with bounding boxes around identified objects.
- **3D Model Visualization**: View a 3D visualization of the model's output.

## Workflow
1. **Select Embedded System Board**: Choose the embedded system board (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, etc.).
2. **Upload Model**: Upload your CNN model in `.h5` format.
3. **Upload Image**: Upload an image to be processed by the model.
4. **Output**: The system will display recognized objects with bounding boxes and a 3D visualization of the model's output.

## Installation
